# Sound Localisation

This project aims to build a simple sound localisation system using Python. The goal is to visually represent the direction-of-arrival (DoA) of real-time sound.

## Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

Our project is based on the work and research of:

-       The beamforming algorithms:
